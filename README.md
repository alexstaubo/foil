Foil
====

Foil is a fast, simple WebDAV proxy written in Ruby, and based on the Rack interface. Foil can adapt any kind of structure (file systems, remote HTTP servers, database models, etc.) into WebDAV resources.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby >= 1.9.2
* Thin (for running standalone)

Running
-------

Create a configuration file. The configuration uses the YAML format:

    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 3000
    pid_path: /var/run/foil.pid
    log_path: /var/run/foil.log
    repositories:
      myserver:
        domain: example\.com
        authentication_url: https://example.com/auth
        notification_url: https://example.com/notify
        mounts:
          /:
            type: local
            local:
              root: /var/www/example
            headers:
              'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
          /public:
            type: s3
            local:
              root: /
              bucket: mybucket
              aws_access_key_id: mykey
              aws_secret_access_key: mysecret

To run a standalone server:

    sudo bin/foil -c config.yml start

Otherwise, simply mount `Foil::Handler` in your Rack application and configure it:

    Foil::Application.new.configure!({:repositories => ...})

Configuration
-------------

Foil routes WebDAV access into a simply layered system of repositories, mounts and adapters:

* Repositories are like virtual hosts: they are associated with a domain or some other pattern that lets Foil know which repository to use based on an incoming requests.
* Mounts simply maps one URI space to an adapter.
* Adapters handle the actual resources. A filesystem adapter is provided, but it's simple to write new ones that work with non-file objects.

Regexp groups from the repository rules can be used later. Here is a repository that maps to a root inferred from the URL:

    repositories:
      myserver:
        domain: ^(?<domain>[^\.]+)\.example\.com
        mounts:
          /:
            type: local
            local:
              root: /var/www/example/{{domain}}
