Foil
====

Foil is a fast, simple WebDAV proxy written in Ruby. Foil can adapt other structures (file systems, remote HTTP servers, database models, etc.) into WebDAV resources.

Requirements
------------

* Ruby >= 1.9.2

Running
-------

* Create a configuration file. The configuration uses the YAML format:

    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 3000
    handler: thin
    pid_path: /var/run/foil.pid
    log_path: /var/run/foil.log
    repositories:
      myserver:
        domain: example\.com
        authentication_url: https://example.com/auth
        authentication_url: https://example.com/notify
        mounts:
          /:
            type: local
            local:
              root: /var/www/example
            headers:
              'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
          /public:
            type: s3
            local:
              root: /
              bucket: mybucket
              aws_access_key_id: mykey
              aws_secret_access_key: mysecret

* Then start the server with:

    sudo bin/foil -c config.yml start
